                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. 
                    Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

                â€œ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
                The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a 
                capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
                You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."
