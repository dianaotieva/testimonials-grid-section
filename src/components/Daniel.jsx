                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
                    if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition 
                    and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course 
                    and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the  best - and most grueling
                    - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
