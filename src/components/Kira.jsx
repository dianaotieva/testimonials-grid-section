                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
                    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on 
                    and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could 
                    ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ”
